- Wallet forked and rebuilt from https://github.com/Spl0itable/wallet
- Campaign invoices forked and rebuilt from https://github.com/Spl0itable/backend_invoices

## How it works
Use the CoinFundIt.com service to generate a Bitcoin (BIP-32) hot wallet using a master seed phrase. The master seed phrase is equally used for Ethereum-based tokens and wallets.

Once a wallet is generated, a new crowdfunding or donations campagin can be initiated. See further tutorial <a href="https://coinfundit.com/how/">here</a>. A campaign URL is dynamically generated, which can be shared across social media to drive visibility to the campaign.

Funders and Donators can use their own CoinFundIt.com-generated wallets to fund or donate to any campaign. Alternatively, a user can connect a third-party wallet using the <a href="https://walletconnect.com/">WalletConnect</a> service.

## Security and privacy
The CoinFundIt.com service is designed with security and privacy in mind. The service uses HTTPS to encrypt all communication between your browser and the server, ensuring that your data is protected in transit. The service does not store any of your personal information, master seed phrase, or private key on the server. The private key is stored in the localStorage of the browser.

The creators of this service do not view or save your private key, view or save your master seed phrase, and are not responsible for any damages or losses resulting from misuse or negligence.
